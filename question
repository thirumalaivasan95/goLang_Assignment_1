You are given two arbitrarily large numbers, stored one digit at a time in a slice.
The first must be added to the second, and the second must be reversed before addition.
The goal is to calculate the sum of those two sets of values.
IMPORTANT NOTE:
The input can be any lengths (i.e: it can be 20+ digits long).
num1 and num2 can be different lengths.
Sample Inputs:
num1 = 123456
num2 = 123456
straight num1= 123456
reverse num2 = 654321
Sample Output:
Result: 777777

1+6 = 7
2+5 = 7
3+4 = 7
4+3 = 7
5+2 = 7
6+1 = 7
